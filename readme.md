This contains shareable code, organized at the top level by organization.
Don't touch things outside of your organization, and don't expect one organization to warrant another's work.

This may seem like a stupid to you, but that's because you don't have access to Motherload.ConsolePlatform, which is how we would share code privately without the headache of multiple repositories.
